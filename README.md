### Custom Classes
- `flex-h` creates a centered flex-row
- `flex-v` creates a centered flex-col

### Custom Colors
- `khoury-...` has been defined for the major khoury colors as well as a light and secondary color.

### Markdown

Any markdown page in `content/manage` is mapped to a page on the website at the route `/manage/...`. For example, `content/manage/example-page.md` will create a page at the route `/manage/example-page`.
